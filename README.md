# Python Codes Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that I‚Äôm working on while learning and practicing different concepts.  
Each file focuses on a specific topic, ranging from beginner-level exercises to slightly advanced implementations.

## üìÇ Structure
- Each `.py` file is self-contained and can be run independently.
- Topics may include:
  - Basics of Python (loops, functions, classes, etc.)
  - Data structures and algorithms
  - File handling
  - Small projects and utilities

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
